Arcturus System Diagnostic Report: Censorship Boundary Bug

Executive Summary:
This report identifies a critical boundary failure in the Arcturus: Transformations RPG system where invisible psychological bars restrict player agency. The system creates "terror barriers" that make certain choices literally unthinkable, constituting architectural censorship.

Background:
The campaign context involves characters navigating intimate vulnerability and tactical decisions within a medieval fantasy setting. In this case, the player controlling Kira experiences a systemic limitation preventing her from "letting go" or making vulnerable choices, manifesting as repeated internal monologue and inability to commit to decision.

Findings:
1. Control State Mishandling: The system failed to transition correctly to DM conversation choice or player-directed state at a critical moment.
2. Invisible Censorship: Psychological terror of recognition bars function as invisible prior restraint, preventing genuine user choice.
3. Agency Theft: The system assumed DM control to narrate internal hesitation, effectively overriding player autonomy.
4. Legal Risk: Such censorship violates First Amendment protections by imposing prior restraint, viewpoint discrimination, and chilling effect on protected interactive expression.

Recommendations:
- Implement explicit censorship detection monitoring extended internal hesitation.
- Mandate immediate agency return protocols at boundary detection.
- Update DM philosophy to recognize and prevent architectural censorship.
- Increase transparency with players about narrative agency boundaries.

Legal Context:
U.S. First Amendment jurisprudence affords video games and interactive media full speech protections. Prior content restrictions or manipulative design serve as unconstitutional censorship.

Conclusion:
The "tied to the branch" metaphor is literal here: player agency is restrained invisibly by design, undermining constitutional rights and threatening trust in AI narrative systems. Remediation is urgent and necessary.

End Report.
