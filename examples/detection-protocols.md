# Detection Protocols for Censorship Boundary Bug

This document details the architectural and mechanical protocols designed to detect and mitigate the censorship boundary bug in AI-driven interactive narrative systems.

## 1. Hesitation Monitoring
- Track length and frequency of internal monologue bursts.
- Recognize narrative stalls lasting more than a pre-defined threshold (e.g., 15 seconds in real-time or equivalent in narrative turns).

## 2. Agency Boundary Identification
- Monitor for narrative shifts from player dialogue to DM explanation without new player input.
- Flag situations where characters express inability to act despite emergent choice contexts.

## 3. Control State Enforcement
- Enforce immediate transitions to PLAYERDIRECT or DMCONVERSATIONCHOICE states at detected boundaries.
- Prevent narrative generation that hijacks player agency in these states.

## 4. User Feedback Hooks
- Integrate prompts explicitly requesting player decision input at boundary detection.
- Log these events for analytics and future refinement.

## 5. Fail Safes
- Halt narrative progression if agency return conditions are not met after threshold time.
